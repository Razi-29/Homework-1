    Hello, My name is Hillary Jean-Pierre. I was born and raised in Miami, Florida but my family originated in Haiti. I have
    a B.S in Microbiology/ Cell Science with the hopes to one-day research new drug development for Antimicrobial
    Resistance. My hobbies are reading 📚, gaming 🎮, baking 🥐, coding 👩🏾‍💻 and traveling ✈🌍.

    <h3> Coding History </h3>
    <div class="aboutmeContent">
    <p class="coding">
    I decided to take up coding for two reasons. The first reason was to challenge me. I felt that I was stagnant in my
    personal development and I wanted to go beyond want I thought I was capable of. Second, I have always had an interest in
    coding languages and web development. While I have only been coding for 3 months, I hope to acquire the skillsets needed
    to work a Front-End developer.
